      <description>About Motivation Philadelphia has a gun violence problem. Homicides have been on the rise since 2013. Last year, 2021, was the deadliest year on record in Philadelphia, with 562 homicides. The city is currently on pace to have nearly as many murders in 2022 as well.

Removing trash and debris Grading the land Planting a small number of trees to create a park-like setting Installing low-perimeter (about 1 meter high) fences with multiple ungated entrances to encourage use Regularly maintaining the lot This approach has been shown to be inexpensive and cost-effective, with costs averaging about $5 per square meter and maintenance averaging $0.</description>
